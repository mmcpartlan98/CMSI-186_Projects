CLOCK CLASS TESTER PROGRAM
--------------------------

  Creating a new clock:
    New clock created: Time: 0:0:0.0
    Testing validateAngleArg()....
      sending '  0 degrees', expecting double value   0.0 - got 0.0
   Wrong number of arguments
   Usage: java ClockSolver <angle> [timeSlice]

throws exception with java ClockSolver -1.0
   Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NumberFormatException: Invalid angle argument!
